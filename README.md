# dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles. The `install.sh` script will install the dotfiles in the home directory. I am assuming you are on macOS using `brew`, `git`, `zsh`, and `stow`.

The `ghostty/.config/ghostty/shaders` is from https://github.com/linkarzu/dotfiles-latest

## Legacy

I have removed the following installs because I have not used them in a while. I will keep their configurations just in case I want them back.

- zellij
- alacritty
- kitty
- wezterm
